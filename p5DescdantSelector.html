<p>Note: The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space (" ") character — combines two selectors
 such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, 
 parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator 
 are called descendant selectors. </p>
